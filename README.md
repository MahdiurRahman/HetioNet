To run:

1. MongoDB
First you have to set up a local MongoDB server. Make sure you can access the MongoDB query system by typing in 'mongo' in your terminal (on Linux and MacOS)

2. Python
    a. Type in the terminal:
        pip install requirements.txt
        OR
        pip3 install requirements.txt
        OR
        pip install pymongo
        OR
        pip3 install pymongo
    (or literally all 4 if you want)

    b. Type in the terminal:
        python main.py
        OR
        python3 main.py

Should be it.
